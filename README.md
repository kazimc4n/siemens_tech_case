# 8D Problem Solving Platform

A simple full-stack application to track problem solving processes.

## Setup & Run

Make sure you have Docker installed and running.

Then just run the start script:

```bash
./start.sh

```

If it gives fetch error, you need to wait almost 5 sec and refresh the page because of backend service.

It will build the containers and wait for everything to be ready.
